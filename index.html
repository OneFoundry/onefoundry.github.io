# Day one - 2021-Aug-07

Researching on which open source solution to use as the foundation for the website/application. We have narrow to Laravel eCommerce stack to jump start the project. So far, Bagisto (https://bagisto.com/) and Aimeos (https://aimeos.org/) have been shortlisted. They are entreprise solutions and supported by commercial company. Hence, these solutions will provide better continuity when faced with issues. We will need to further assess the technical merits, and which our developers are more comfortable with.
